## <font face= "Georgia" span style="color: #97ccc4ff;">The Use Case</span> 

<font face= "Arial" span style="color: black;"></span> 
Nobody likes getting a parking ticket, but administering parking tickets is actually beneficial for cities in a variety of ways. Consistent parking enforcement by city governments leads to greater respect for parking regulations, fewer instances of illegal parking that may obstruct traffic or endanger bicyclists and pedestrians, and more dollars of ticket revenue that are critical to so many city budgets. For these reasons, cities should be interested in strategies that allow more consistently enforcement of parking regulations in order to maximize the social and financial benefits that are likely to result. 

Most cities employ a workforce of parking enforcement officers that are responsible for identifying illegally parked vehicles and administering tickets. For this project, we set out to design a new approach to parking enforcement that would both increase the volume and reduce the costs of parking ticket administration for cities. 

## <font face= "Georgia" span style="color: #97ccc4ff;">Our Solution</span> 

<font face= "Arial" span style="color: black;"></span> 
Our solution is an app called Denizen that allows cities to crowdsource their parking enforcement to ordinary citizens, and equips those citizens with the predictive power of big data. We want to allow anyone to give a parking ticket to vehicles that have parked illegally or for longer than theyâ€™ve paid at a meter.  Our app helps users identify locations likely to have parking infractions, report individual vehicles, and be rewarded for doing so. We think there is a significant opportunity to get ordinary citizens more involved in government activities in ways that beneficial for both parties, and we think parking ticket enforcement is a great use case to start with.
